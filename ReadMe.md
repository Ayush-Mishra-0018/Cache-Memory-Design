Designed a 4-way set associative cache with 1024 KB size and 32-bit address.<br>
<br>
Tasks:<br>
- Analyze hit/miss rates using provided memory traces.<br>
- Vary cache size (128 KB to 4096 KB) and observe changes in hit/miss rates.<br>
- Vary block size (1 byte to 128 bytes) and analyze the effect on cache performance.<br>
- Vary associativity (1-way to 64-way) and study its impact on hit rates.<br>
<br>
Output: Hit/miss rates and performance graphs for different configurations.
